# Applied-Machine-Learning-

The focus of this course was: 
Discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics. 
Supervised approaches for creating predictive models by applying the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). 
The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. 
Identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis.
